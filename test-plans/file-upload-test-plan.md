# RoleVault File Upload Feature - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Application Overview

The RoleVault application is a secure, role-based vault system that provides file management capabilities for users with different permission levels. The File Upload feature is a core component located at `http://localhost:5001/upload` and provides the following functionality:

- **Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop file upload zone with click-to-browse fallback
- **File Size Limitation**: Maximum file size of 10MB enforced
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions control who can upload files
- **User Roles**: Administrator, Contributor, and Viewer with different permission levels
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with test accounts available
- **Navigation**: Accessible via sidebar menu "Upload File" link

### Role-Based Permissions

Based on the role permissions data:
- **Administrator**: Full upload permissions (`rv.files.upload`)
- **Contributor**: Upload permissions (`rv.files.upload`)
- **Viewer**: No upload permissions (only download and request access)

- Actual file storage location and persistence not tested
- Upload progress indicators existence not confirmed from UI exploration
- File type restrictions not confirmed (may need backend verification)

### Test Automation Recommendations
- Use Playwright's `page.setInputFiles()` for file upload automation
- Leverage test fixtures for different user roles (already available in codebase)
- Create helper utilities for file generation and cleanup
- Implement retry logic for flaky network-dependent tests
- Use visual regression testing for UI consistency checks
- Add API-level tests to complement UI tests for file upload validation

## Conclusion

This test plan provides comprehensive coverage of the RoleVault File Upload feature, addressing functional requirements, security considerations, accessibility standards, and cross-browser compatibility. The test scenarios are designed to be independent, repeatable, and suitable for both manual and automated execution using the existing Playwright + TypeScript framework.

**Total Test Scenarios**: 51 detailed test cases covering all aspects of file upload functionality.

**Estimated Execution Time**: 
- Manual execution: ~8-10 hours (full suite)
- Automated execution: ~30-60 minutes (depending on file sizes and parallel execution)

**Framework Integration**: All tests can be implemented using the existing page object model pattern and fixtures defined in the codebase, ensuring maintainability and consistency with current testing standards.
